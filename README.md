# Getting started with GithubActions

This repo focuses on dockerizing a <a href="https://github.com/pm-dikshita/Start-with-GithubActions/blob/main/hello.py"><code>hello-world python application</code></a> locally and then creating a docker image of it. For this purpose, no GitHub actions was used initially.
